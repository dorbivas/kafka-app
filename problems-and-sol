1. Problems and Solutions Document
This document should cover the challenges you faced during the setup and deployment of your application, including any issues with Minikube, Docker, Kafka, and Kubernetes, as well as the solutions you implemented. Here's a template you can use:

Problem 1: Environment Setup
Description: Initial difficulties in setting up Minikube with sufficient resources.
Solution: Configured Minikube to start with specific CPU and memory allocations using the command: minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192.
Problem 2: Kafka Deployment
Description: Challenges in achieving high availability with Kafka in a local Kubernetes setup.
Solution: Utilized Bitnami Kafka Helm chart which supports configuration for high availability. Customized the values.yaml to include multiple replicas and persistent storage.
Problem 3: API Rate Limiting
Description: Encountered API rate limits while trying to fetch data every 60 seconds.
Solution: Implemented error handling in the API producer to deal with rate limiting by retrying the request after a brief pause.
Problem 4: Data Serialization
Description: Issues with data serialization and deserialization between the producer and consumer.
Solution: Used JSON for data serialization. Ensured consistent serialization and deserialization methods in both producer and consumer scripts.
