High-Level Architecture:

API Producer: A Python application that runs every 60 seconds to fetch data from an external API and sends it to a Kafka topic.
Kafka Cluster: Deployed using the Bitnami Kafka Helm chart on Kubernetes, ensures high availability and data persistence.
Kafka Consumer: A Python application that continuously listens to the Kafka topic, consumes data, and prints it to stdout.
Components:

Minikube: Local Kubernetes cluster.
Kafka Helm Chart: Manages the deployment of Kafka.
Python Applications: Two separate components for producing and consuming messages.
